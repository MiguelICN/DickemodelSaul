## [Weyl symbols](@id Dicke.TruncatedWignerApproximation.Weyl)
The submodule `TruncatedWignerApproximation.Weyl` generates classical phase-space
observables that may be passed as the argument `observable` of [`average`](@ref Dicke.TruncatedWignerApproximation.average), [`calculate_distribution`](@ref Dicke.TruncatedWignerApproximation.calculate_distribution), etc. All the following functions [SymEngine](https://juliahub.com/docs/SymEngine) objects,
so they may be operated as if they were numbers.
