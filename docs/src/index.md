This package is a result of more than two years of investigation of the [Dicke Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dicke_model). It contains numerical methods that were used in the following publications:

It is split into several submodules:
* [`ClassicalDicke`](@ref DickeModel.ClassicalDicke) allows to compute classical dynamics of the Dicke model, including a wide range of semiclassical aproximations to quantum properties.
* [`ClassicalSystems`](@ref DickeModel.ClassicalSystems) provides a general framework for computing classical Hamiltonian dynamics, inlcuding Lyapunov exponents. It is mostly used for the Dicke model, but in principle it can be expanded to other Hamiltonians.
* [`DickeBCE`](@ref DickeModel.DickeBCE) provides multiple functions for analyzing the quantum Dicke model. It uses an efficient basis known as the Efficient Coherent Basis (BCE). See Refs. above.
*  [`UPOs`](@ref DickeModel.UPOs) contains a set of functions to find unstable periodic orbits (UPOs) in the classical Dicke model. (See Ref. 3)
*  [`TWA`](@ref DickeModel.TWA) allows to perform semiclassical calculations using the truncated Wigner approximation (TWA). (See Refs 2,5)
* [`EnergyShellProjections`](@ref DickeModel.EnergyShellProjections) contains a set of functions to integrate functions over the classical energy shells of the Dicke Model. It also contains specialized functions to compute these integrals for the Husimi functions of quantum states, which define phase-space localization measures known as RÃ©nyi occupations (See Refs. 1 and 2)
* [`ClassicalLMG`](@ref DickeModel.ClassicalLMG) provides very basic functions for the classical Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model. (See Ref. 5)
* [`PhaseSpaces`](@ref DickeModel.PhaseSpaces) provides some canonical transformations of the Bloch-Sphere.
