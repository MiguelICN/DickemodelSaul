# Dicke.PhaseSpaces
This module provides formulas for the cannonical transformation ``(Q,P)\mapsto (\theta,\phi)`` 
we use throughout this package. 

!!! note
    There is an unfortunate problem between the characters ``\phi`` (`\phi`)
    and ``\varphi`` (`\varphi`): [some fonts render one as the other](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/8429#issuecomment-56274108). 
    To avoid errors, the functions below treat the two characters indistinctly. 
    In the references, the glyph ``\phi`` is used.
